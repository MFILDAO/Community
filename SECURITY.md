## MFIL Security

The MFIL project is under active construction, and we invite security researchers acting in good faith to help us maintain high standards of security.

If you find a security risk or vulnerability in MFIL:
- Please Contact us! [@MFILDAO](https://github.com/MFILDAO)
- Please do not discuss MFIL vulnerabilities in the public community!

In the early stage of the MFIL project, we are temporarily unable to pay high remuneration for your help, but we do not mean that we want to prostitute your labor for nothing.

In the development of MFIL, we will set up a certain incentive plan, which will include **Bug Bounty Program**.

### Issues

If you find a code error, please report it in the issue of the corresponding repository, please follow the issue guidelines of the repository.

### response process

Our core developers poll each repository for issues, and fix bugs and security holes within 30 days of discovering or receiving them.
