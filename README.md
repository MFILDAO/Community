## About

Welcome to the MFIL DAO community repository! You can treat this repo as your go-to for all meta, non-code discussions in the [*Discussions Forum*](https://github.com/sghmok/Community/discussions), documents used by multiple repositories (such as the Code of Conduct), and how to interact with the MFIL project and other community members.

If you are interested in discussing code or protocol design, feel free to come talk to us on our [forums](#forums), or in issues on our other [MFILDAO repos](https://github.com/MFILDAO).

## Join the Community

**Before posting to different communications channels, make sure to read the Code of Conduct.**

The vast majority of the MFIL conversations, including implementation, community support, ecosystem news, etc. take place on:

- Forums (mainly on Github Discussions)
- Chat (mainly on Discord)
- GitHub Issues

The MFIL is a DAO governance project with a very supportive and welcoming community, where many community members are responsive in various forums and slack channels. 

Implementation dev teams tend to check their corresponding GitHub repo issues and discussions regularly and try to respond within 5 business days.

We also push updates to the community via:

### MFIL DAO Community Forum

When in doubt or curiosity, please post in [MFIL DAO community forum](https://github.com/sghmok/Community/discussions)!

We love to hear what the community has to say, whether it is to:

- Ask a question
- Gather community feedback on a new feature proposal before opening an MIP 
- Share a new project you're working on
- Find collaborators for your own community project
- And whatever else! Honestly!

The discussion forum uses the same [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sghmok/Community/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) as our other community channels. Please make sure to read this before posting.

### GitHub issues

If you find something puzzling or encounter a straight-up bug in any of our repositories, please file a well-scoped issue. The issue lists for our most active repositories are below:

- [`Community`](https://github.com/sghmok/Community/issues)
- [`MIPs`](https://github.com/sghmok/MIPs/issues)
- [`MFIL-Contracts`](https://github.com/sghmok/MFIL-Contracts/issues)
- [`MFD-Contracts`](https://github.com/sghmok/MFD-Contracts/issues)

If a repo has a Contributing Guide, please read it before filing an issue!

### Security issues and disclosures

Almost anything you find that is a bug in the codebase should be filed as an issue. The exception is if you find a security vulnerability. The MFIL is still under heavy development. This means that there may be problems in our protocol design or implementations.  We take security vulnerabilities very seriously! If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

Please refer to [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) document found in this repo on how to best report findings.
