We believe that our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly,
safe, and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices will not be tolerated.

## tl;dr

- Be respectful.
- Abusive behavior is never tolerated.
- Violations of this code may result in swift and permanent expulsion from the MFIL DAO community.
- "Too long, didn't read" is not a valid excuse for not knowing what is in this document.

## Scope

We expect all members of the MFIL DAO community to abide by this Code of Conduct
at all times in all MFIL DAO community venues, online and in person, and in one-on-one
communications pertaining to MFIL affairs.

This policy covers the usage of MFIL public infrastructure, as well as other MFIL websites, MFIL related events,
and any other services offered by or on behalf of the MFIL DAO community. It also
applies to behavior in the context of the MFIL Open Source project
communities, including but not limited to public GitHub repositories, IRC
channels, social media, mailing lists, and public events.

This Code of Conduct is in addition to, and does not in any way nullify or
invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of MFIL services.

## Friendly Harassment-Free Space

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for
all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity,
religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal
characteristics.

We ask that you please respect that people have differences of opinion
regarding technical choices, and that every design or implementation choice
carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer.
A difference of technology preferences is not a license to be rude.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing
behavior is not welcome, and will not be tolerated.

Harassing other users is never tolerated, whether via public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing nicknames, or other identifiers that might
detract from a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but is not limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or
written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar
personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images, and/or
sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-
physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing
photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events;
inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

Media shared through public infrastructure run by the MFIL DAO team must not
contain illegal or infringing content. You should only publish content via
MFIL public infrastructure if you have the right to do so. This includes
complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property
restrictions. You will be solely responsible for any violation of laws or
othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

## Avoid Marketing or Soliciting

You are welcome to post endorsements of tools, products or services that you
personally find useful, but please refrain from blatant advertising, marketing
or any kind of spam. Selling commercial services or fundraising is not allowed.

## Reporting Violations of this Code of Conduct

If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this Code of
Conduct, please contact us at [@MFILDAO](https://github/MFILDAO) to send us an abuse report. If
this is the initial report of a problem, please include as much detail as
possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

## Consequences

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the MFIL DAO team
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund
in the case of a paid event or service).
